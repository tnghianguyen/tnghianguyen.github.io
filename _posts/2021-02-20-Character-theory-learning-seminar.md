# Details

- Organizers: Trung-Nghia Nguyen and Hoang-Viet Do;
- 12:30-16:30 on Wednesdays, Spring 2021;
- Place: Room H2.2 - VNUHCM-University of Science.

Our aim is to cover foundational material on the theory of characters of finite groups following by the classical textbook "Character Theory of Finite Groups"[^1] by Isaacs. Some material is referred to G. James and M. Liebeck[^2] as well.
