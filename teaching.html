<h2>Teaching and Outreach</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In Fall 2021, I was a teaching assistant to MTH00086 Discrete Mathematics at VNUHCM-US.</li>
    <li>In Spring 2021, I was one of the two instructors of the selected team of VNUHCM-US to enter Vietnam Mathematical Olympiad for Undergraduates, giving lectures on problem-solving strategies in linear and abstract algebra.</li>
    <li>Apart from that, I have been an enthusiastic long-standing member of <a href="https://pimavn.github.io/" target="_blank">Projects in Mathematics and Applications (PiMA)</a> where I have been serving as multiple pivotal roles such as an organizer, a counselor and a mentor.</li>
