<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
    Hello! I am from Vietnam and my Vietnamese name is Nguyễn Trung Nghĩa. To be consistent with my English legal documents, I prefer to use Trung Nghia as my first name and Nguyen as my last name. I am currently a first year PhD student in Mathematics at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. <br>
</p>

<h1>Research</h1>
<h2>Publications</h2>
<ol reversed>
    <li>(with L.Q. Danh and N.K. Ngoc) Subpermutable subgroups of skew linear groups and unit
        groups of real group algebras, <i>Bull. Korean Math. Soc.</i> (2021). <a href="https://doi.org/10.4134/BKMS.b200212" target="_blank">Link</a></li>
</ol>

<h2>Talks/Presentations</h2>
<ul>
    <li> In August 2021, I delivered an online talk on brief introduction to tensor categories in the language of string diagrams in the <a href="http://math.ac.vn/conference/TC2021/" target="_blank">Workshop "Tannakian Categories"</a> hosted by <strong>Professor Phung Ho Hai</strong> and sponsored by Hanoi Institute of Mathematics.</li>
    <li> In September 2020 at the REU Symposium, I gave a talk on basic theory of affine group schemes.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Teaching and Outreach</h1>
<ul>
    <li>In Fall 2021, I was a teaching assistant to MTH00086 Discrete Mathematics at VNUHCM-US.</li>
    <li>In Spring 2021, I was one of the two instructors of the selected team of VNUHCM-US to enter Vietnam Mathematical Olympiad for Undergraduates, giving lectures on problem-solving strategies in linear and abstract algebra.</li>
    <li>Apart from that, I have been an enthusiastic long-standing member of <a href="https://pimavn.github.io/" target="_blank">Projects in Mathematics and Applications (PiMA)</a> where I have been serving as multiple pivotal roles such as an organizer, a counselor and a mentor.</li>
