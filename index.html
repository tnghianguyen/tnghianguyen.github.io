<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Xin chào! I am currently a first year PhD student in Mathematics at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. I am from Vietnam and my Vietnamese name is Nguyễn Trung Nghĩa. To be consistent with my English legal documents, I prefer to use <strong>Trung Nghia</strong> as my first name and <strong>Nguyen</strong> as my last name. <br>
